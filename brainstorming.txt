## Project Brainstorming:

# Purpose:
We're constantly forgetting basic facts about people in our lives.
It's not that we don't want to remember. We are just overwhelmed with data.
This app has one purpose: to easily fill in the basic outline of the people in our lives.
As we remember peoples' stories, it will revolutionize our interactions.

# Mechanics
M - Models (??? Do I need more than two? Can also do events)
>>> Contacts belong to users (their stored details are only visible to logged-in users)
>>> Users have many contacts
  User features: Each user has a username, email, and an id.
  Contact features: Each contact has a First name, last initial, and an id.
  After that, part of the functionality of this app - want metaprogramming


  *****THE DREAM CODE*****
   that allows you to add in new features on the fly [Asuka][:hometown] Osaka
  Also want functionality to query all by these new features... is that possible?

V - Views
  Using ERB, HTML, CSS:

  Homepage
  Logo - fuzzy silhouette
  Homepage - "filling in the basic outline"
  Brief description
  Links to login, signup, view all contacts

  Overall scheme
  Theme encompasses blacks & greys (main) vs whites & pale-to-bold yellows (highlights)
  Serif font (communist) for headers and logo
  San-serif font for main text (try communist sans or gotham narrow? & sants bold for links)



C - Controller
Routes:
Main:
  / - explanation of the app and links to login, signup, view all
User:
  /users/new - signup
  /users/login - login
  /users/logout - logout*
  /users/delete - delete*
Contact:
  /contacts - index action to show all contacts*
  /contacts/new & post /contacts - action to create a new contact*
  /contacts/:id/edit & patch /contacts/:id - action to edit / add information to contact*
  /contacts/delete - for that inevitable breakup. deletes a contact*
* = Methods require user to be logged in.


# Other requirements:
  Validate username & password
  Validates data to prevent blank/bad data going in
  Flash messages


# To-dos today:
  Research metaprogramming to make new table columns/decide query bit
  Set up basic file, database, and model structure
